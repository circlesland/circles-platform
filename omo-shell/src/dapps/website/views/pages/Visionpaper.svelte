        In the history, money has always been connected to other references of
        value, such as seashells or gold, impersonating the role of representing
        a true store of value. Only recently in the human evolution, through the
        introduction of fiat money, the reference was abandoned, in favor of
        trying to keep economic activity, prices and monetary supply in balance.
        This resulted in a continous growth of money supply, inflating the total
        amount of debt based money, while silently reducing the purchasing power
        of the lower classes. In heavy crisis times people tend to loose trust
        in their government issued fiat currencies, thus even devaluating fiat
        even further, creating a run on alternative stores of values such as
        real estate, company shares or cryptocurrencies.

        percentage of the money you own compared to others. On the blockchain,
        every transaction is calculated and documented in Circles. Circles
        yearly growth rate is at 7% a year, which is the same as the 7% decay
        rate of the ⦿. While the nominal Circles Unit keep on growing over the
        years, we believe introducing a better reference unit, which is coupled
        to the time alive and has its equillibrium at 125.000⦿, will result in
        better predictability of prices on the long run. Psychological wise,
        using relative units shows a much higher transparency on the actual
        inflation, which currently devaluates your purchasing power without you
        noticing it. On the other hand and increase in economic growth,
        strenghens the value of the ⦿ unit and bringing price pressure, which
